Data Collection: Gather the dataset for which you want to find the median. Ensure the data is complete and accurate.

Sorting: Arrange the dataset in numerical order, either in ascending or descending order. This is essential for calculating the median.

Determine the Dataset Size: Calculate the number of data points in the dataset, denoted as n.

Calculate the Median:

Odd Dataset: If n is odd, the median is the data point located at the center of the sorted dataset. This can be calculated using the formula:
Median
=
data point at position
(
�
+
1
2
)
.
Median=data point at position( 
2
n+1
​
 ).
Even Dataset: If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle data points in the sorted dataset. Calculate the positions of the two middle data points as:
Lower Middle
=
�
2
Upper Middle
=
Lower Middle
+
1.
Lower Middle= 
2
n
​
 
Upper Middle=Lower Middle+1.
Then, calculate the median as:
Median
=
Lower Middle
+
Upper Middle
2
.
Median= 
2
Lower Middle+Upper Middle
​
 .
Validate the Median: Review the calculation to ensure the median accurately represents the center of the dataset.

Document Findings: Record the calculated median and any additional observations or insights derived from the data.
